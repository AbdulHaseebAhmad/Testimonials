                    can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                    very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                    I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
